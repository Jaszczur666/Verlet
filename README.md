# Verlet
This project has many goals, but getting efficient code is not one of them.
I play with this project
* to get some rust from my head.
* to remember some long ago forgotten tricks
* to exercise writing code in C#
* to find some semi-useful thing to do in downtime

This project is not guaranteed to work, although my final aim is that it should.
Not sure I'm there yet, but nevertheless it seems to agree quite well with papers in the field.
